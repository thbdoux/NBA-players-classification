# NBA players classifier

Data exploration of NBA players statistics in order to predict if a player is likely to last more than 5 years in the NBA according to his stats in-game.
Developed an API to an interactive use of the classifier.
Model still needs to be improved, probably by introducing more features to the dataset.

Model is trained and coded in main.ipynb. Run app.py and load the webpage to use the classifier.
